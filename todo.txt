NEWER
Adding keylinks is broken


Change camel case variables to underscores
Change how storage, saving and syncing work
Finish renaming setting names


BUGS

Check formatting on other devices

Possibly add support for enter key when keylink can be deleted

Weird undefined value bug

Change bookmark not selecting input contents

Improve look of dropdown bookmarks folder box

Syncing does not work properly when there are a large number of existing keylinks

Find a better export icon and center it properly

Keyword can still be added for a split second after it becomes an invalid keyword
This can happen when a keyword is too long (becoming a 26 character key)
When a keyword is already taken (replacing the existing key)
When the keyword is an empty string (which then becomes a key)

Undefined bug still happening in change / delete bookmark page
Brief red border when there shouldn't be
