Visit Keylinks
------
To quickly visit a keylink, select the Chrome omnibox (shortcut Ctrl+L) and type a period followed by a space.  
Type the keyword, and press enter. If the keylink exists, it will take you to your destination, otherwise a page will inform you that the keyword is incorrect.  
If omnibox suggestions are enabled, keyword suggestions will appear below the omnibox as you type.
